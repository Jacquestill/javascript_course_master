/*
There are two gymnastics teams, Dolphins and Koalas.
They compete against each other 3 times.
The winner with the highest average score wins the
a trophy!

1. Calculate the average score for each team, using
the test data below
2. Compare the team's average scores to determine
the winner of the competition, and print it to
the console. Don't forget that there can be a draw, so
test for that as well (draw means they have the same
average score).

3. BONUS 1: Include a requirement for a minimum score
of 100. With this rule, a team only wins if it has a
higher score than the other team, and the same time a
score of at least 100 points. HINT: Use a logical
operator to test for minimum score, as well as
multiple else-if blocks ðŸ˜‰
4. BONUS 2: Minimum score also applies to a draw!
So a draw only happens when both teams have the same
score and both have a score greater or equal 100 points.
Otherwise, no team wins the trophy.

Koalas score 88, 91 and 110

/*
Steven wants to build a very simple tip calculator for
whenever he goes eating in a resturant. In his country,
it's usual to tip 15% if the bill value is between 50
and 300. If the value is different, the tip is 20%.

1. Your task is to caluclate the tip, depending on the
bill value. Create a variable called 'tip' for this.
It's not allowed to use an if/else statement ðŸ˜…
(If it's easier for you, you can start with an if/else
statement, and then try to convert it to a ternary
operator!)
2. Print a string to the console containing the bill
value, the tip, and the final value (bill + tip).
Example: 'The bill was 275, the tip was 41.25, and
the total value 316.25'

TEST DATA: Test for bill values 275, 40 and 430

HINT: To calculate 20% of a value, simply multiply it
by 20/100 = 0.2
